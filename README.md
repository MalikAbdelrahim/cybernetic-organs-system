# cybernetic-organs-system
A futuristic company specializing in creating bio-compatible cybernetic organs for human augmentation and replacement. This project will require a deep understanding of object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms to simulate the complex interactions between biological and mechanical components.

Patient Class: This class stores patient info and will hold the data on each patient.

CyberneticOrgan Class: This class will hold data about the cyber organ itself and compatibility with patient.

OrganInventory Class: This class stores data on the amount of organs we have.

More detail on how to run program coming later.
